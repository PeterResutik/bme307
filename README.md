## Course Description

**General Overview**  
This course focuses on the analysis of gut microbiomes in healthy subjects and in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The composition of gut microbiomes is investigated through typisation of 16S rRNA genes. Analyses of microbial diversity within and across samples, as well as exploratory supervised classification, are carried out using bioinformatics tools. Inflammation in the gut is assessed via histology and Western blotting of marker proteins.

**ECTS Credits**: 6

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the module, students should be able to:

- Provide an overview of how the microbiome is involved in health and disease  
- Describe the interactions and interdependencies of microbial communities in humans  
- Outline the contribution of bacterial taxa in influencing the development of inflammatory diseases  
- Apply wet-lab assays and bioinformatics tools to assess microbial diversity and disease severity  
- Carry out basic analyses of microbial diversity using bioinformatics tools
